The Game of Frupal

Frupal is an adventure game where the player character visits a mysterious land in search of the secret "magic jewels". 
As the player explores, their map will fill in with the places they've been (and also been near too) so that the player can backtrack easily if need be.
Along the way the player will encounter various obstacles that they will have to clear by either finding hidden items, or by buying them from shopkeeps.
The player will also have to contend with an energy system that will drain as they move about, putting pressure on the player to think about every move they make. However, players can revitalize themselves by finding the right items or by visiting a hot-springs type area.
